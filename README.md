## Casting Agency
### Overview & Motivation
The Casting Agency models a company that is responsible for creating movies and managing and assigning actors to those movies. You are an Executive Producer within the company and are creating a system to simplify and streamline your process.

I have developed this project to practice my knowledge in pythonÂ obtained from the Udacity full stack developer nanodegree.

Please note that some of the functions are reused from my previous FSND projects.

## Getting Started

### Installing Dependencies

#### Python 3.7

Follow instructions to install the latest version of python for your platform in the [python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#getting-and-installing-the-latest-version-of-python)

#### PIP Dependencies

Once you have your virtual environment setup and running, install dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all of the required packages we selected within the `requirements.txt` file.

##### Key Dependencies

- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)  is a lightweight backend microservices framework. Flask is required to handle requests and responses.

- [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) is the Python SQL toolkit and ORM we'll use handle the lightweight sqlite database. You'll primarily work in app.py and can reference models.py. 

- [Flask-CORS](https://flask-cors.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) is the extension we'll use to handle cross origin requests from our frontend server. 

##### Export the variables as environment variables
```bash
source setup.sh
```


## Database Setup

##### Update Connection String
[`config.py`](config.py)

##### Run the migrations
```bash
python manage.py db init
python manage.py db migrate
python manage.py db upgrade
```

## Running the server
From within the directory, simply execute:

```bash
python app.py
```

## Testing
##### Run the tests
```
python test_app.py
```

## Api Reference
### Error Handling
Error are returned as JSON objects in the following format:
```json
{
  "success" : False,
  "error" : 400,

```
The API will return four error types when requests fail:
- 400: Bad Request
- 404: Resource Not Found
- 405: Method Not Allowed
- 422: Unprocessable
- 500: Internal Server Error
